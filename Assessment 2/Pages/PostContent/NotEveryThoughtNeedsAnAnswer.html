                Sometimes it's fine letting thoughts wander without an immediate answer.

                Some thoughts arrive without any clear purpose they dont come with a problem to solve or a conclusion
                for them to reach
                they simply exist be it briefly, quietly and just disappear as easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its tempting in trying to aswer each one analyzing it until it has a conclusion or just makes sense but
                not every one of them
                ask for that kind of attention some are just passing through and forcing an answer can bring more than
                than satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized that some thoughts are better left unanswered or ignored doing so will lighten you of burdens
                of trying to answer each one
                they not permenant they will be gone sooner or later when you ignore them leaving a sense of space than
                tension, sometimes its better
                in letting a thought wander around than to be solved.
