                Overthinking may be productive at first giving you the illusion of analyzing or replaying a moment and
                sooner enough clarity will
                appear but sometimes it just creates noise your thoughts just becomes more hazy and heavier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overthinking usually starts with good intentions wanting to understand, wanting to avoid mistakes,
                making things right somewhere along the way
                that intention turns into hesitation the mind circling the same ideas over and over not to solve them
                but being busy with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to that at some point its better to just let it go accept that it wont have an answer yet
                it does not need to be resolved yet
                the most productive thing you can do at that point is stepping back and actually try doing something
                productive than thinking and maybe then it will
                answer itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                OVerthinking wants control but letting go begins with trust in yourself and time and clarity will soon
                show itself soon.
