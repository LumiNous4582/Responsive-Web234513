                Creativity rarely arrives on our whims or commands days past by without ideas flowing easily, where our
                thoughts
                connect naturally and where everything feels effortless to do. Then there are days where nothing happens
                a string of silence
                stretched throughout the day which then leads to forcing creativity to come which only results into you
                frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
                For quite some time i treated thosse quiet days as failures as i failed in forcing creativity
                assumptions lead to me losing motivation
                or just falling behind before finally realising that creativity just simply moves at its own pace like
                how waves comes and go.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned to respect how it comes and go and adjusted how i worked as instead of just forcing creativity
                i observe, collect ideas, rest and repeat
                as that way maybe it'll come faster and when it arrives i give it a room to exist as it wont last long
                but its fine as waiting again for it
                to come back again is part of the process.
