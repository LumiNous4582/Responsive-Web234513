                Being busy usually feels like progress theres comfort in having a busy schedule, task to complete and
                something that always demands your attention
                giving you the impression of using time well even if the results are unclear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Productivity on the other hand is quieter it doesn't come with a sense of urgency or visible effort it
                may look like focusing on one thing
                for longer than expected or choosing to do less to do it better.
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference i noticed between the two is that busyness is responding to everything at onces while
                productivity selects what really matters
                the most and makes other problems wait for their turn the difference between the two may not always be
                obvious at some moments but it becomes more
                clear overtime.
