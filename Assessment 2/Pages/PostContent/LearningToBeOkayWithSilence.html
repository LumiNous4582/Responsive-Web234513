                Silence is often avoided as we fill it with noise, conversations, notifs, or background noises treating
                it as if that
                silence is uncomfortable by default yet silence isn't really a problem but rather what comes when
                everything falls silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it falls silent your thought surfaces more clearly it may be overwhelming especially when those
                thoughts are unresolved or not familliar
                to you its easy to distract ourselves than to sit with thoughts when its silent, silence ask for
                attention even if you dont want to give it some
                and its uncomfortable at first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its okay to be with silence even if your thoughts surfaces more clearly some of them does not require
                any meaning or answers their simply asking for attention
                simply asking for a moment of silence and peace where nothing happens theres a certain peace within it
                that doesn't require action it can exist without it being
                filled, explained or fixed and in those moments you may know more about yourself than ever.
