                Its easy to overlook small wins as they dont feel impressive at all and that they dont really change
                anything much
                most of the time they pass by unnoticed because were working on what needs to be done the goal itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                A finished task, a small improvement, and a moment of consistency, these dont stand out as much but over
                time they quietly stack up
                and even though their small and dont seem to really do much their actually doing more work for us than
                we realize and made us who were are.
            </p>
            <p>
                Small wins dont need a celebration or attention its enough to just notice them and recognize that
                something move forward even slightly
                noticing it is enough, as over time it becomes clearer that the most meaningful thing ever was that
                something small and once insignificant
                gathered and became bigger and significant.
