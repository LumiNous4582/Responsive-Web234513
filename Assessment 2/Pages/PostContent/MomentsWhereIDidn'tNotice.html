                Some moments pass without asking for your attention they dont announce themselves or feel important at
                the time
                it's only later when they resurface again, small details, expressions or choices that is now set in
                stone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Were so focused on what comes next the mind moving faster than its present moment to the point were
                skipping over things that dont seem urgent at the time and in doing so we miss a few small yet important
                things
                not because they weren't important but rather people failing to notice them yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back those moments that seem small at the time become bigger reminding us that not everything
                announces its importance
                as some stay quiet and waiting patiently for us to slow down and look back to see them
            </p>

                Cherised every moment
