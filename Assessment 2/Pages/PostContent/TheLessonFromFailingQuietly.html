                Not every failure can be seen as some comes quietly, without any witnesses and dramatic consequences and
                no one ever knowing
                these are often failures that lingers with you the longest
            </p>
            <p>
                Failling quietly does not mean it mattered less in fact it can and will feel heavier precisely because
                theres no one to process it for you
                no one points it out, no one to assure you only you notice it and carry it forward silently.
            </p>
            <p>
                As time passed i realised these failures and moments tend to also teach more than the louder ones,
                without attention or any pressure your
                left alone to process it and reflect on it, replay what happened not punish yourself but rather to
                understand it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quiet failures often reshape us they influence us on how to prepare ourselves again if something similar
                happens again the change
                isn't immediate or obvious but its there.
            </p>
            Maybe thats the lesson not every mistake needs to be visible in order to be useful as some of the most
            meaningful growth can happen
            even without no one watching.
