                I used to think a smile only mattered when something good happens that it was just a response and not a
                choice
                but unexpectedly just smiling despite not being happy can sometimes change how it unfolds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its not dramatic or instant change as nothing became perfect by just smiling, yet by just smiling
                changes me little by little
                i never noticed until everything started to become lighter, thoughts less stress, time still feels slow
                but right, conversations feels
                more better it made me realised a small smile can change anything even if theres nothing good in the
                world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Im not suggesting that a singular smile can fixed everything nor that it could replaced its genuine
                emotions we feel,
                we'll all encounter heavy, and silent days and thats fine just smiling you have them can be an act of
                kindness from you and to others,
                so when the world pushes you down and drop you get up and SMILE.
