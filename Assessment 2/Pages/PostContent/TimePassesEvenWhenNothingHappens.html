                There are always days when nothing feels memorable nothing major, no event, no progress and no moments
                that stood out enough to be remember
                later they just pass by quietly blending with days similar to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time does not slow down during these moments even when it feels still and slow time is still moving at
                the exact same time without hesitation

            </p>
            <p>
                Its easy to believe that time only matters when something is happening, if change is visible and growth
                is measured but everything matters even
                the smaller moments whether the days are uneventful or not, maybe their not empty at all and just hard
                to notice and perhaps thats enough.
